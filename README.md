The Adventures of Heron

This game is about the adventures of the farmer Heron. He lives in his farm near the good castle and
supplies it with his yield. But once, when he got home, he sees a group of demons kidnaping his
wife! Heron chases them and suddenly, a silhouette appears in a shadow, which transforms Heron's
wife to a golden sword. Then, the silhouette disapears together with the sword. Help Heron finding
his wife and getting her back.
